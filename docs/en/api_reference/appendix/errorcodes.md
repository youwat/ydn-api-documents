# SOAP Error Codes
### Error Process Outline
When a SOAP request is successful, YDN API sends back the "HTTP 200 OK" response code, along with a SOAP response. <br>If an error occurs while a SOAP request is being processed, YDN API sends back a message with an error code. <br>
For details, please refer to [Error](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Common/Error.md) and/or [ErrorDetail](/docs/en/api_reference/data/Common/ErrorDetail.md).<br>

### Sample Error Response

Following 3 types of error are possibly responded: SOAPFault, Full error and Part error.

#### SOAPFault

SOAPFault is caused by WSDL violation, SOAP syntax violation, server system error or authentication error.<br>
The form is one of these responses below by each service.

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <SOAP-ENV:Fault>
      <faultcode>110006</faultcode>
      <faultstring>Can not login.</faultstring>
      <faultactor/>
      <detail>
        <requestKey>apiAccountId</requestKey>
        <requestValue>xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx</requestValue>
      </detail>
    </SOAP-ENV:Fault>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Header/>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <SOAP-ENV:Fault>
      <faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Client</faultcode>
      <faultstring xml:lang="en">110006:Can not login.</faultstring>
      <detail>
        <ApiExceptionFault xmlns="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812/Account">{"details":[{"key":"license","value":["xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"]},{"key":"apiAccountId","value":["xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"]}]}</ApiExceptionFault>
      </detail>
    </SOAP-ENV:Fault>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

#### Full Error

Although it is not SOAPFault, Full Error is caused by failing a entire request due to request constraints.<br>
Note that Part Error is respond when the request fails due to constraints within each `<operand>`.

The following response is an example of Full Error in the case of the invalid value of `numberResults` of `Paging` in [AccountService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/AccountService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Header xmlns:ns1="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812/Account" xmlns:ns2="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812">
    <ns1:ResponseHeader>
      <ns2:service>Account</ns2:service>
      <ns1:timeTakenSeconds>0.1234</ns1:timeTakenSeconds>
      <ns1:requestTime>1234567890</ns1:requestTime>
    </ns1:ResponseHeader>
  </SOAP-ENV:Header>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <getResponse xmlns="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812/Account" xmlns:ns1="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812">
      <error>
        <ns1:code>F0001</ns1:code>
        <ns1:message>Invalid format.</ns1:message>
        <ns1:detail>
          <ns1:requestKey>selector/paging/numberResults</ns1:requestKey>
          <ns1:requestValue>1000000</ns1:requestValue>
        </ns1:detail>
      </error>
    </getResponse>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

#### Part Error

Part Error is caused by constraints within each `<operand>`.<br>
Unlike Full Error, Part Error responses whether an error occurred for each `<operand>` or not.<br>
The response possibly contains `<operationSucceeded>` with mixed `true` and `false` value when you send a single SOAP request which includes multiple `<operand>`.

The following response is an example of Part Error in the case of the non-existent `reportId` in [ReportService](/docs/ja/api_reference/services/ReportService.md).

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <SOAP-ENV:Header xmlns:ns1="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812/Report" xmlns:ns2="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812">
    <ns1:ResponseHeader>
      <ns2:service>Report</ns2:service>
      <ns2:timeTakenSeconds>0.1234</ns2:timeTakenSeconds>
      <ns2:requestTime>1234567890</ns2:requestTime>
    </ns1:ResponseHeader>
  </SOAP-ENV:Header>
  <SOAP-ENV:Body>
    <ns3:mutateResponse xmlns:ns2="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812" xmlns:ns3="http://im.yahooapis.jp/V201812/Report">
      <ns3:rval>
        <ns2:ListReturnValue.Type>ReportReturnValue</ns2:ListReturnValue.Type>
        <ns2:Operation.Type>ADD</ns2:Operation.Type>
        <ns3:values>
          <ns2:operationSucceeded>false</ns2:operationSucceeded>
          <ns2:error>
            <ns2:code>I0001</ns2:code>
            <ns2:message>Deactivated Id.</ns2:message>
            <ns2:detail>
              <ns2:requestKey>reportId</ns2:requestKey>
              <ns2:requestValue>1234567890</ns2:requestValue>
            </ns2:detail>
          </ns2:error>
        </ns3:values>
      </ns3:rval>
    </ns3:mutateResponse>
  </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```
